   <p><em>Senior level undergraduate studying <strong><a href="https://cs.utdallas.edu/">Computer Science at The University of Texas at Dallas</a></strong> aspiring
       to be a software engineer. </em>
   </p>
   <br2>
   <p>I am aspiring to obtain a 2023 Summer internship in software development to
     utilize my skills in a team and work with team members towards achieving our goals.
     To this end, I am going to continue to grow my skills to become the most effective team member I can be: building my tech stack in
     my free time, and actively developing my communication skills to become the most communicative team member I can be.
